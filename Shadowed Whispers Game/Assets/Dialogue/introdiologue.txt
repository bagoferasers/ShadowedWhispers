You know, despite everything that's happened... it's kinda funny how winter remains my favorite season.
There's snowboarding, snowball fights, cozy blankets, fires, mulled wine,
aaaand a muuuuch needed break from mosquitos.

*main character chuckles softly* 

 What's not to like, right?

*small pause*

There's something about the way the world transforms under a blanket of snow - 
it's almost like it's trying to hide its secrets, only just for a while.

*small pause*

I never imagined the labrynth of shadows and whispers I was about to step into. The quiet
surface of the rural setting was just a mask for the bullshit.

If only I could have a conversation with the human I was then, on that first winter day.
I'd offer them this: embrace the cold, embrace the quiet, for it's within those moments that the loudest
truths are often found.

*sigh*

I never wanted any of this.
